        I got a new monitor last Black Friday. A friend recommended getting a light bar that hangs above the monitor. It
        looks like another chance to utilize my circuit making skills.

      <p>
        I’ve been planning and prototyping for a while actually. First I was trying to figure out how bright I want it
        to be. My current desk lamp uses one of those fist-sized bulb that is labeled 800 lumens. I felt it was a
        comfortable reading luminosity. To reach that level, the LEDs I’ve used and seen is not enough as they are
        usually rated as a few dozens of lumens. This light bar should be as compact as possible using the brightest
        LEDs.

        I have a bike flash light. It only has one LED as light source when I look into its head. I searched ‘flash
        light LED’ on the internet and found out about this series of <a
          href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/filter/led-lighting-white/124?s=N4IgTCBcDaIBoAUAyBBA6gFQLQAYe73xAF0BfIA">ultra-bright
          LEDs on Digikey</a>. I ordered some that has a comfortable temperature for my reading habit. I also
        learned that they have a line that has the range of wavelength suitable for plant growth. This will be my next
        grand plan, a plant plan!
      </p>
      <p>
        I built the circuit in KiCAD with one LED first. It’s my first time adding surface-mount transistors to my
        circuit and soldering such a narrow footprint on the LED. I ended up making two versions of this debugging board
        to figure out these two problems. For the second problem, I find using this kind of <a
          href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/filter/led-lighting-white/124?s=N4IgTCBcDaIBoAUAyBBA6gFQLQAYe73xAF0BfIA">low-temperature
          soldering
          paste</a> helpful. And the trick is that since it requires such a low temperature to reflow, heating the
        footprint
        on one leg of the LED will generate enough heat to reflow the paste on the other leg as well.

        I made a acrylic base for it for a floating vibe. It lacks certain degrees of freedom in adjusting its position
        and actually ended up hurting my eyes when I sat down.

        One thing I didn’t take into consideration is the power limit of resistors. I burned the current limiting
        resistor and had to order high-power resistors. The copper trace was destroyed too, so I had to be creative.

      <p>And one day I just found the perfect base for this light bar.</p>

      <p>Now it sits right above my monitor.</p>
