        <p class="abstract">
          Morphing structures are often engineered with stresses introduced into a flat sheet by leveraging structural
          anisotropy or compositional heterogeneity. Here, we identify a simple and universal diffusion-based mechanism
          to enable a transient morphing effect in structures with parametric surface grooves, which can be realized
          with a single material and fabricated using low-cost manufacturing methods (e.g., stamping, molding, and
          casting). We demonstrate from quantitative experiments and multiphysics simulations that parametric surface
          grooving can induce temporary asynchronous swelling or deswelling and can transform flat objects into
          designed, three-dimensional shapes. By tuning the grooving pattern, we can achieve both zero (e.g., helices)
          and nonzero (e.g., saddles) Gaussian curvature geometries. This mechanism allows us to demonstrate approaches
          that could improve the efficiency of certain food manufacturing processes and facilitate the sustainable
          packaging of food, for instance, by creating morphing pasta that can be flat-packed to reduce the air space in
          the packaging.

          Food is an overlooked yet growing field of HCI that democratizes the science and engineering of shape changing
          and self-folding materials. This project introduces parametric surface grooving as an effective method to
          morph a variety of materials ranging from flour-based food to elastomers. Here, we investigated how
          geometrical parameters of grooves can affect swelling ratio, as well as experimentally demonstrated and
          simulated the multi-stage morphing effect of such structures. This mechanism can be applied to food design and
          production, and expand the library of 'expansion' of soft materials.
        </p>
        <p>
          I collaborated with designers and makers in this project. My role is to find alternative materials that
          justify the generality of our theory, characterize the microstructure of the pasta dough with which we started
          this project.
