      <p class="abstract">
        From providing nutrition to facilitating social exchanges, food plays an essential role in our daily lives and
        cultures. In this work, we seek to expand this design space by adapting support bath-assisted printing to the
        food context. The bath scaffolds the embedded materials and preserves shapes during the printing processes,
        enabling us to create freeform food with fluid-like materials. We provide users guidelines for choosing the
        appropriate support bath type and processing methods depending on the printing material's properties. A design
        tool suite and application examples, including confectionery arts, 4D printed food, and edible displays are also
        offered to demonstrate the enabled interaction design space.

      <p>Many desserts uses gelatin (jelly) as one of the main ingredients, and their making process involves the
        finesse and craftsmanship of the chef. In this design example, using computationally controlled embedded
        printing enlarges the shape-design space of sweets and allows hobbyist makers to design and make personalized
        dishes in their kitchens. We showed jelly printed with an alginate-carrot ink.</p>

      <p>In addition to the issue associated with the melted chocolate's fluidity, when printing shapes that are
        inherently 3D, such as the objects shown below, conventional layer-by-layer direction extrusion techniques and
        slicers would also be unable to capture the smoothness of the model. By contrast, using the Carbopol support
        bath and our design tools suite (polycurve-to-toolpath function) allows us to create freeform structures with
        ease and broadens the geometrical design space of 3D chocolate printing. </p>

      <p>Dough, made of flour and liquid (e.g., milk, water), is an exemplary food material that may have a wide range
        of properties, viscosities, and design spaces depending on the ratio between its ingredients. For instance,
        dough with low water content is viscous and can be easily modeled into 2.5D shapes for baking cookies or bread,
        while dough with high water content is more fluidic and deformable and is widely used for making puffable flat
        food like pizza. As a result of this difference in fluidity, current 3D printing techniques are mostly limited
        to using low-hydration dough for making foods. In this work, we use dough with different water content levels
        for validating fluidic material printing. Its ingredients are also standardized, accessible, and common
        products, making it an ideal model material of liquid foods.</p>

      <p>We conducted a co-design workshop with Shelby Costo, a pastry chef who lives and runs her independent business
        in Ohio. Our goal is to understand how the tool can support her creative practice. All the artifacts shown below
        are edible, with flavors and ingredients suggested by the chef, printed by our embedded printing process. </p>

        The red ball (casted): Freeze-dried strawberries, water, honey, lemon juice, gelatin powder
